Whether you’re a total newcomer to coding or an experienced analyst who’s never made a map, Mapping the World with R turns “I-wish-I-could-do-that” into “I-just-did-that.” In crisp and straightforward language, it shows you exactly how to install R, wrangle real-world spatial data, and publish beautiful, ethical maps—step by step, project by project.


# What You’ll Create & Learn

11 hands-on projects that start with “Hello, mapper!” and finish with slick, publish-ready visualizations.
Dozens of bite-size exercises so you can practice each new skill the moment you meet it (skip the theory tunnel, build muscle memory instead).
Authentic data, served automatically via R packages: no dead links or dummy CSVs. You’ll learn to cope with messy, real-life datasets the way professionals do.
Clear, fully annotated code in every chapter, plus a companion GitHub repo you can clone, tweak, and remix.
